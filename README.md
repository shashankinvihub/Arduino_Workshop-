📌 Importance of Using the Serial Monitor
The Serial Monitor is an essential tool when working with Arduino because:

✅ Debugging:

You can print variable values and messages to understand what's happening in your program.

📡 Communication:

It allows your Arduino to send and receive data from your computer.

🧪 Testing Sensors & Inputs:

You can read values from sensors or buttons and see them in real time.

🧰 No Display Needed:

Useful when you don’t have an LCD or other visual output—Serial Monitor becomes your main interface.

⚙️ Fine-tuning and Control:

You can send commands to the Arduino (like typing "on" or "off" as in your earlier example) to control devices or change behavior on-the-fly.
